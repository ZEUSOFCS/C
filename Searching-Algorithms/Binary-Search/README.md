# Binary-Search

This binary search program is an efficient algorithm for finding an item from an ordered list of items.

Binary search, also known as half-interval search or logarithmic search, is a search algorithm that finds the position of a target value within a sorted array. It compares the target value to the middle element of the array; if they are unequal, the half in which the target cannot lie is eliminated and the search continues on the remaining half until it is successful.

Note:
This program does not include a sorted array, therefore the user has to input the list of data in chronological order.
